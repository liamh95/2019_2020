\item Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating $y=e^x$ about the x-axis between $x=-1$ and $x=1$.  Sketch the solid and a typical cross section.

\item Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by $x=y^2$, $x=1$, $y=4$ about the y-axis.  Sketch the solid and a typical cross section.
\vfill

%\item Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by $y=x^3$, $y=1$, $x=2$ about the line $y=-3$.  Sketch the solid and a typical cross section.

\item Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating the region bounded by $x=y^2$, $x=1-y^2$, about the line $x=3$.  Sketch the solid and a typical cross section.
\vfill

%\item Find the volume of the solid whose base is bounded by $y=\sin x$, $y=\cos x$, $x=0$, $x=\pi/4$ and whose cross sections are semi-circles oriented such that the diameter lies upon the base and is perpendicular to the x-axis.
%\vfill

\item Find the volume of the solid whose base is bounded by $y=0$, $y=1/x$, $x=2$, $x=4$, and whose cross sections are squares oriented such that a side lies on the base and is perpendicular to the x-axis.
