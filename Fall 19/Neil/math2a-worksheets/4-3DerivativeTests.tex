\begin{enumerate}
\item Given $f(x)=2x^3-9x^2+12x-3$ 
%$f(x)=e^{2x}+e^{-x}$
find,\\
(a) the intervals on which the function is increasing and decreasing,\\
(b) the local maximum and local minimum values, and\\
(c) the intervals of concavity and any inflection points.\vfill

\item Find the local extreme points and values functions using the first derivative test and again using the second derivative test.\\
%$f(x)=1+3x^2-2x^3$
$f(x)=\displaystyle \frac{x^2}{x-1}$\vfill

%\item Sketch the graph of (a) a function whose first and second derivatives are both positive for all $x$ and (b) a function whose first and second derivatives are both negative for all $x$.\vfill

\newpage

\item Sketch the graph of (a) a function whose first derivative is positive and whose second derivative is negative for all $x$ and (b) a function whose first derivative is negative and whose second derivative is positive for all $x$.\vfill

\item In an episode of The Simpsons, Homer reads from a newspaper and announces "Here's good news!  According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate."  Interpret Homer's statement in terms of a function and its first and second derivatives.\vfill
