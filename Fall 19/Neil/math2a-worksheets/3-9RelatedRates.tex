\begin{enumerate}
\item A cylindrical tank with radius $5 m$ is being filled with water at a rate of $3 m^3/min.$  How fast is the height of the water increasing?\vfill

%\item The radius of a sphere is increasing at a rate of $4 mm/s$.  How fast is the volume increasing when the diameter is $80 mm$?\vfill

\item If $x^2+y^2+z^2=9$, $dx/dt=5$, $dy/dt=4$, find $dz/dt$ when $(x,y,z)=(2,2,1)$.\vfill

%\item A particle is moving along a hyperbola $xy=8$.  As it reaches the point $(4,2)$, the y-coordinate is decreasing at a rate of $3 cm/s$.  How fast is the x-coordinate of the point changing at that instant?\vfill

\newpage

%\item A streetlight is mounted at the top of a 15 foot pole.  A man 6 ft tall walks away from the pole at 5 ft/s along a straight path.  How fast is the tip of his shadow moving when he is 40 feet from the pole?\vfill

\item At noon, ship A is 100 km west of ship B.  Ship A is sailing south at 35 km/h and ship B is sailing north at 25 km/h.  How fast is the distance between the ships changing at 4:00 pm?\vfill

\item Water is leaking out of an inverted conical tank at a rate of 10,000 $cm^3/min$ at the same time water is being pumped into the tank at a constant rate.  The tank has height 6 m and the diameter at the top is 4 m.  If the water level is rising at a rate of 20 cm/min when the height of the water is 2 m, find the rate at which water is being pumped into the tank?\vfill
