\begin{enumerate}
\item Find 2 numbers whose difference is 100 and whose product is a minimum.\vfill

%\item The sum of two positive numbers is 16.  What is the smallest possible value of the sum of their squares?\vfill

\item A farmer wants to fence in a rectangular plot of land adjacent to the north wall of his barn.  No fencing is needed along the barn, and the fencing along the west side of the plot is shared with a neighbor who will split the cost of that portion of the fence.  If the fencing costs 20 dollars per linear foot to install and the farmer is not willing to spend more than 5000 dollars, find the dimensions for the plot that will enclose the most area.\vfill

\newpage

%\item If the farmer in the previous problem wants to enclose 8000 square feet of land, what dimensions will minimize the cost of the fence?\vfill

\item A box with a square base and open top must have a volume of 32,000 $cm^3$.  Find the dimensions of the box that minimize the amount of material used.\\\vfill

\item Find the point on the curve $y=\sqrt{x}$ that is closest to the point $(3,0)$.\vfill
