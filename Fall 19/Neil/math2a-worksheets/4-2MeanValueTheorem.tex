\begin{enumerate}
%\item Verify that the function $f(x)=\sin(x/2)$ satisfies the 3 hypotheses of Rolle's Theorem on $[\pi/2,3\pi/2]$.  Then find all numbers $c$ that satisfy the conclusion of Rolle's Theorem.\vfill

\item Verify that the function $f(x)=x^3-3x+2$ satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem on $[-2,2]$.  Then find all numbers $c$ that satisfy the conclusion of the Mean Value Theorem\vfill

\item Show that $2x+\cos x=0$ has exactly 1 real root.\vfill

\newpage

\item Let $f(x)=2-|2x-1|$.  Show that there is no value of $c$ such that $f(3)-f(0)=f'(c)(3-0)$.  Why does this not contradict the Mean Value Theorem?\vfill


\item Two runners start a race at the same time and finish in a tie.  Prove that at some time during the race they have the same speed.\vfill

%\item If $f'(x)=c$ (a constant) for all $x$ prove that $f(x)=cx+d$ where $d$ is some constant\vfill

%\item A number $a$ is called a fixed point of a function $f$ if $f(a)=a$.  Prove that if $f'(x)\neq1$ for all $x$ then $f$ has at most one fixed point. (Hint:  Assume $f$ has a fixed point and consider the function $g(x)=f(x)-x$ to show that $f$ cannot have any other fixed points.)\vfill
