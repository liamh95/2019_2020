\noindent\textbf{Problem. }Fix a prime $p$. How many invertible $n\times n$ matrices are there over $\field_p$? In other words, find $|\GL_n(\field_p)|$.
\begin{solution}
	We use the elementary fact from linear algebra that a matrix is invertible if and only if its rows are linearly independent. We proceed by a counting argument.\\

	\noindent Suppose $A\in \field_p^{n\times n}$ is invertible. How many possibilities are there for the first row of $A$? We need the rows to form an independent set, so the first row can be anything but the zero vector, which gives $p^n - 1$ possible first rows ($p^n$ row vectors in total, minus the one ``bad'' vector).\\

	\noindent How many possible second rows? Whatever the second row is, it must be independent of the first row, so it can be anything but a multiple of the first row. There are $p$ possible multiples of the first row since we're working in $\field_p$, so there are $p^n - p$ possible second rows.\\

	\noindent How many possible $k$-th rows? The $k$-th row can be anything but a linear combination of the $k-1$ rows that came before it. A linear combination of the rows $v_1, \ldots v_{k-1}$ looks like
	\[
	c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + \cdots +c_{k-1}v_{k-1},
	\]
	where the $c_i$'s come from $\field_p$. There are $k-1$ constants to choose, each of which can take any value in $\field_p$, so there are $p^{k-1}$ linear combinations in total. We want to get rid of these, so there are $p^n - p^{k-1}$ possible $k$-th rows.\\

	\noindent Now we put it all together.
	\begin{align*}
	|\GL_n(\field_p)| &= \#\{\text{possible first rows}\} \cdots \#\{\text{possible $n$-th rows}\}\\
	&= (p^n-1)(p^n-p)\cdots (p^n-p^{n-1})\\
	&= \prod_{j=0}^{n-1}(p^n-p^j).
	\end{align*}

	\noindent From here you answer other questions like how big is $\SL_n(\field_p)$, the set of $n\times n$ matrices with determinant 1. Consider the map $\det: \GL_n(\field_p)\to \field_p^\times$. Since the determinant is multiplicative, the map $\det$ is a group homomorphism. By the first isomorphism theorem, $\GL_n(\field_p)/\ker \det \cong \field_p^\times$. The kernel of $\det$ is the set of matrices that get sent to $1$, which is exactly $\SL_n(\field_p)$. We then have $|\GL_n(\field_p)|/|\SL_n(\field_p)| = |\field_p^\times| = p-1$. Rearranging gives
	\[
	|\SL_n(\field_p)| = \frac{1}{p-1}|\GL_n(\field_p)|.
	\]
\end{solution}
